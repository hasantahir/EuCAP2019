In this paper, we present a corrosion monitoring scheme for biodegradable cardiovascular stents composed of magnesium alloys. We show that the structural integrity of such mesh-type tubular stents can be evaluated using millimeter-scale electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic scattering from the simulation results indicates that the resonant frequency decreases as the structure thickness degrades with time.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and it accounted for an estimated 30\% of all deaths in the year 2013 globally \cite{benjamin_heart_2017}. Clogging of the heart vessels is the biggest factor responsible for the development of the CVD. These days, it is a common clinical practice to reopen the heart vessels through balloon angioplasty, and place a mesh-type metallic scaffolding tube called a stent to reinforce the vessel walls.  However, due to the long-standing presence of a metallic foreign object in the form of a stent, serious health complications arise chief among which is the reclogging of the vessels in the long term, especially in the vicinity of the stent. From a medical perspective, an ideal stent would be the one that serves its purpose of reopening and stabilizing the heart vessels and then disappear \cite{waksman_biodegradable_2006}.  The biodegradable stents  precisely offer such a possibility where the scaffold structure completely corrode away after performing the reinforcement of the heart vessel walls \cite{hou_review_2016}.

Research into biodegradable polymers and metals has been on-going, but the inherent superior mechanical properties of metals make them more attractive for biodegradable stent application compared to polymers \cite{chen_recent_2014}. Among metals, zinc and magnesium-based alloys have both shown promise for degradable stent applications, but as of today, only Mg-based biodegradable stents have been clinically tested in humans \cite{staiger_magnesium_2006,esmaily_fundamentals_2017}. More importantly, Mg is also vital in maintaining a healthy heart, and given the weight of a typical coronary stent is in the range of \SIrange{3}{5}{\milligram}, the release of Mg ions is unlikely to cause any adverse effects.

One of the biggest engineering challenges presented with the use of a biodegradable stent is that its structural integrity must be maintained until the stent completely breaks down and is metabolized in to the bloodstream. To ensure this, the stent and its biodegradation due to corrosion needs to be monitored through non-invasive means. In this paper, we propose an electromagnetic monitoring scheme that monitors the structural integrity of a biodegradable stent using millimeter waves (mm-waves). Compared to the microwave wave imaging, mm-wave provide higher spatial resolution. On the other hand, mm-waves can penetrate deeper into the human tissue compared with the optical frequency counterparts. Using full-wave 3D electromagnetic simulations, we show that the stent corrosion can be determined with the help of the frequency change in the scattering properties.

\section{Methodology}
%

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as “3.5-inch disk drive.”

Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.

Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: “Wb/m2” or “webers per square meter,” not “webers/m2.” Spell units when they appear in text: “...a few henries,” not “...a few H.

Use a zero before decimal points: “0.25,” not “.25.” Use “cm3,” not “cc.”

\section{Some Common Mistakes}
The word “data” is plural, not singular.
The subscript for the permeability of vacuum 0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter “o.”
In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
A graph within a graph is an “inset,” not an “insert.” The word alternatively is preferred to the word “alternately” (unless you really mean something that alternates).

Do not use the word “essentially” to mean “approximately” or “effectively.”
In your paper title, if the words “that uses” can accurately replace the word using, capitalize the “u”; if not, keep using lower-cased.
Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones “affect” and “effect,” “complement” and “compliment,” “discreet” and “discrete,” “principal” and “principle.”
Do not confuse “imply” and “infer.”
The prefix “non” is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
There is no period after the “et” in the Latin abbreviation “et al.”
The abbreviation “i.e.” means “that is,” and the abbreviation “e.g.” means “for example.”
Use the expression “reflection coefficient” if you refer to S11 in dB, which must be negative for a passive antenna while the “return loss” is a positive quantity.
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{Young}.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.

% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
